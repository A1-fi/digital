<p class="p1">My name is inigo montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die-</p>

<p class="p1">As an artist, I figured it was about time to give this whole thing a try-</p>

<p class="p1">Hi. As you might already know, I’m an artist-</p>

	</div>

<p class="p1">All of those were potential ways to start this first blog post. I didn’t like any of them much. Too much irony, too corny, all of it far too superficial. Like trying to play into people’s expectations of what a quirky artist should write like. So we’re doing this a different way. </p>

<div class="cente">

<p class="p1">No less stereotypical, but hopefully a bit more heartfelt.</p>

	</div>

	<p class="p1">Like most of us I was brought into this world during a calamity. About 1,000 miles away from where I was being born, one of the worst hurricanes to hit the US was tearing through the city of parties, nightlife and music, New Orleans. Wouldn’t it have been ironic if I was named Katrina? Despite my parents forgoing the tasteless namesake, crisis had already begun to follow me. Or maybe I followed it. It’s hard to tell sometimes. </p>

	<p class="p1">“Speed demon” is what my parents used to call me. If you had asked me, I would’ve said it was my lucky lightning socks that made me fast. More than anything though it was my competitive nature that had a tendency to bore into everything I touched. I wanted to be the best. There were several options that were of the utmost importance to 10 year old me.</p>

	<div class="cente">

<p class="p1">The Fastest</p>
<p class="p1">The best at Drawing</p>
<p class="p1">The best at Reading</p>
<p class="p1">The most Daring</p>

	</div>

	<p class="p1">But I never did settle for just one. As much as I’d like you to believe I claimed all of those titles, I think I only really ever had a grasp on two. The best at drawing, which is an obvious one, but the other that I finally did reach out and touch was a little less triumphant. It was confidence and arrogance that got me the title of the most daring. It only took one jump to tear one title away and replace it with the other.</p>

	<div class="cente">

	<p class="p1">It wasn’t the first time I had broken a bone. But it was the first time I had broken two at the same time. </p>

	</div>

<p class="p1">I leapt. I flew through the air. I tasted freedom and bravery and joy. But then I slipped. Suddenly the two most important instruments to my craft were taken from me. Both my arms were broken. For most people, such an occurrence would probably have been a time of turmoil; pain and agony mixing with the loss of a beloved passion. I got a taste of a new thing I wanted to be the best at though. The most Resilient. My mom probably said it first, considering I was back at school the day after I got out of the hospital, but once it was put into words, there was no stopping me. I learned how to write all over again, but more importantly, how to draw. </p>

<p class="p1">After the casts were removed, I came out of them better than I had gone. I drew the cover for the book my class published before the end of the year. There was nothing to stop me. Normally, this is where a twist would occur that would ultimately halt the hero’s journey. But this isn’t a story, this is my life. Oh the thing did come though, it just took a few more years. </p>

<p class="p1">Covid swept the nation when I was 14. Suddenly, everything was online, and I still didn’t have a phone*. I did have a computer though, and I saw an opportunity. My social life was out the window, and so I focused on learning. Youtube became my best friend. I attempted juggling. Failed. I attempted solving a rubik's cube. Failed. The only logical course of action after that was drawing.</p>

	<div class="cente">

<p class="p1">*I had a tracfone with 100 texts a month</p>

	</div>

<p class="p1">I buried myself in review videos for drawing tablets, drawing software, everything I needed to start the transition to online that everything else around me had already taken. When it all arrived at my door, I was ecstatic, and that’s where my art journey went from a passion to an obsession. </p>

<p class="p1">I would draw during class, free time, not free time, anywhere I could squeeze in a moment. This sudden new and frankly overwhelming ability to make The Cool Art led me to progressing at a pretty steady but steep rate. I learned how to be the best at something new those coming months. Before, it had always been something I hoped for but never actually took steps towards. I was finally pushing myself for the improvement I wanted to see. I learned how to be Dedicated. But it was just a hobby, I assured myself. Nothing I could do for a job.</p>

<p class="p1">My mom ultimately suggested it my senior year, when I was agonizing over what I wanted to do with my life. I knew what I wanted to do with my life, I had already been doing it for years, but who hasn’t heard the starving artist stories? I couldn’t dedicate my life to something fruitless, could I? As it turns out, I could.</p>

<p class="p1">I still don’t know what I’m going to do with my life to be honest. Everything could go wrong. It sure has before. But I also know that every time it has, I learn how to be the best at something new. I learned how to be Daring. I learned how to be Resilient. And I learned how to be Dedicated. And though they might not be all I need to succeed, they’re the building blocks to get there. I learned to take leaps of faith, fall down and break both arms, but then get right back up again and keep moving forwards even stronger. </p>

<img src="vampire.png" width="100%" alt="=a drawing of a vampire drinking tea">

<p class="p1">With Halloween right around the corner, what better way to ease into this blog than a bit of vampirism. I’ll be honest. I don’t like this piece all that much. Putting it up here is somewhat of a challenge for me–because of a couple of reasons.</p>

<p class="p1">Now those not acquainted with making art among you out there might be thinking it looks good. Great even. Like there’s nothing to change, like I’m being dramatic. But those who do make art–who make things at all perhaps–are familiar with hating nothing more than your own creations.</p> 

<p class="p1">Whether it’s because you can see all the mistakes you made along the road to get there, or it’s simply because things you make have less worth than what others have made in your mind. Either way, we love to hate our own expressions of ourself, too bad too ugly too unfinished to release to the world, but behind it all, it’s our fear of feeling too vulnerable.</p>

<p class="p1">And that’s why this must be shared. All artists, no matter how good, have bad pieces, by their own standards or ours. With each progression in skill, a bad piece of art is better and better but mistakes don’t stop no matter how good you get.</p> 

<p class="p1">As much as I don’t like this piece of art, because it doesn’t fulfill my standards you might like it. You might like it because you think it’s good, or you might like it because it shows you that I’m not all that great at art. It doesn’t take away from my life to share it, and if anything, it might make yours a little better.</p>

<p class="p1">The perfectionist in me wants so desperately to fix whatever I’m unhappy about with this piece, but I can’t seem to pin it down to just one thing. The colors feel faded and boring, the lighting isn’t quite right, things are–but I need to stop.</p>

<p class="p1">The constant desire to fix pieces I’m unhappy with will only drain me (and probably make me dislike it more). It’s not finished. But by any of my own definitions of finished, none of my art pieces are. I have to fight with myself to let pieces go. Release them out in the world. There’s a bar I hold myself to, and this one doesn’t hit it. But here it is, out here anyways, and that’s okay. It doesn’t make me a bad artist, it doesn’t make this piece bad, it doesn’t even make this piece any less important to my art journey. I did what I could to it with the skills I currently have, and it didn’t work out.</p>

<p class="p1">Getting better at art isn’t having no problems, just less. Every piece of my art is in a constant state of depreciation under my gaze. I like it less and less the longer it’s around because I’m constantly getting better. It doesn’t mean it isn’t good though. It’s what I could do at the time. I’m saying this as much for myself as I am for you. A reminder that we’re all human– well, except for this vampire of course.
